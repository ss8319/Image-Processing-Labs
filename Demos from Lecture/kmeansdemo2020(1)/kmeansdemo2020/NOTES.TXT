% gkmeans notes:  graphical k means
% Minimal example of means using only 2 dimensions for easy
% visualisation and code understanding
%
% NOTE - This code was updated to make it easier to understand
% in March 2016, then some additional checking added March 2020
% to avoid display problems on Matlab version 2019.
% Also improved clarity of calling both demos
% 
% 

% Basic running of the code; from Matlab prompt,
% Note that the data is held in two separate arrays,
% so in a sense are already labelled. However, the
% purpose of this is just to emphasise that there are
% points drawn from two distinct distributions: later on,
% we will lump them into one unlabelled arrayâ€¦.
load classA;
load classB;

% Combine into one array; could make the combination of these
% random, so that classes are separated and not in any particular order
C=[A;B];

% Run, using one example of initialisation
[class,m]=gkmeans(C,2,20,1);

% A different initialisation
[class,m]=gkmeans(C,2,20,2);

% Another example of initialisation
[class,m]=gkmeans(C,2,20,3);

% The modified kmeans is demonstrated below
% gmkmeans notes: "graphical" modified k-means
load classA;
load classB;
C=[A;B];
[class,mu,p]=gmkmeans(C,3,20,4);
